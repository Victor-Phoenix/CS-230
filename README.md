Reflection on the Software Design for The Gaming Room
Throughout this course, I worked on creating a software design document for The Gaming Room, a client who wanted to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, from Android to other platforms like web and desktop. The game is a multiplayer experience where teams try to guess what is being drawn. Each team and player needed to have unique names, and the game needed to run multiple sessions at the same time. My task was to design the software in a way that would meet all these needs while making sure the game could grow in the future without major issues.

The design document helped to clearly communicate how the software would work to the client and the development team. It outlined how the game’s different parts would work together, including handling players and teams, and how the game would ensure that names were unique. We used patterns like Singleton to make sure only one instance of the game service was running at a time, and Iterator to easily manage lists of teams and players. These design choices were necessary to make sure the game could handle more players and teams without causing problems later on.

One of the things I think I did well was making the software design easy to follow. The document was structured in a clear way, so both technical and non-technical people could understand how the software would work. This was important because The Gaming Room needed to be sure the game would work on different platforms. The design showed how the server would handle most of the work, while the game could be accessed through different devices, like desktops or mobile phones. I believe this was a strong point of the project because the client’s needs were met in a way that allowed for future growth.

Working through the design process was helpful because it gave me a solid plan to follow once I started developing the code. By thinking through all the details early on, I could make sure that the code would be easy to maintain and scale. For example, it was useful to plan how the game data, like teams and players, would be stored and accessed. This made the coding phase smoother because I already had a clear idea of how everything would fit together. In the future, I will definitely continue using design documents as a way to plan ahead before coding.

If I were to go back and change something in the design document, I would focus more on security. While I did include some security features, such as making sure user data is stored securely and only one instance of the game runs at a time, I could have gone further. For instance, I would add more about how to protect the game from unauthorized access and ensure data protection across all platforms. This is important because, as the game expands, more users will access it, and keeping their data safe should be a top priority.

Understanding the client’s needs was a key part of this project. The Gaming Room wanted to make sure their game could grow without major changes. This meant the design had to be flexible enough to add more features later on without causing problems. By focusing on what the client wanted, I was able to design a system that could meet their current needs while also allowing for future updates. Keeping the user’s needs in mind is important because it helps ensure the software works for the people who will be using it.

My approach to designing the software was to break down the client’s requirements into smaller, manageable parts. For example, I focused first on how the teams and players would be organized, then I moved on to how the server would handle multiple games running at once. This step-by-step method helped me stay organized and made it easier to ensure all the details were covered. In the future, I will use this same method to design software because it ensures that I don’t miss important details. Additionally, I learned the importance of getting regular feedback from the client to make sure the design stays aligned with their needs.

In conclusion, working on this project helped me understand the importance of careful planning and clear communication when designing software. By focusing on the client’s needs, I was able to create a design that met the requirements and allowed for future growth. The process of creating the software design document also made the coding phase easier, as I had a clear roadmap to follow. Moving forward, I will continue to use these techniques to ensure that my software designs are effective and easy to understand for both clients and development teams.

Note: This project was fictional and used as a practice exercise to learn and apply industry standards in software design and development.
